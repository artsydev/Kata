# Trip Service Kata

This code is my solution to [Sandro Mancuso's Trip Service Kata][1].

## What is it about?

The challenge of this kata is to refactor a small block of code containing many common issues found in legacy code. Before refactoring can begin, you must first write the unit tests. There is one other rule:

> We can't change any existing code if not covered by tests. The only exception is if we need to change the code to add unit tests, but in this case, just automated refactorings (via IDE) are allowed. 

## Using

* Java 8
* JUnit 5 / Hamcrest
* Mockito (possibly, we shall see...)
